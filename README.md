# OtsuBRSG - Detecting River Bank of Kaziranga National Park
Presents a modified Otsu based Boundary Refining using Savitzky Golay (Otsu-
BRSG) method for identifying the river bank line and forest boundary of the Kaziranga National Park
(KNP) region in Assam, India from Landsat images and analyse land cover changes over a decade from the
year 2008 to 2018. Detecting the river bank line in an area of dynamic land cover change is an extremely
difficult challenge due to rough uneven terrain and dense vegetation. The proposed Otsu-BRSG method is applied on this region to analyse the change of
the bank line region over starting from 2008 to 2018. The paper quantifies erosion over 10 years in the
region using change in bank line edge which directly impacts the National Park. Analysis have shown a net
loss of 540.63 ha forested area in the critical region over a decade highlighting an alarming trend of erosion
in the studied time span (2008-2018).
